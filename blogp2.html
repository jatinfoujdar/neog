            <h2>You can check out the podcast<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/64DAmk1B7H07uxFOac5TYv"> Here
                </a> </h2>
            <p>In this podcast, Tanay discusses the broad pros and cons of whether a masters degree is really required
                to become a good programmer. Everyone, especially engineers, faces the dilemma of whether investing so
                much money into a master’s degree and changing continents is really worth it? Let’s dive into some of
                the aspects that are explored in the podcast, which you should consider when deciding:</p>
            <h1 class="underline">Why you should do it?</h1>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Become an expert:</strong> If you decide to pursue a master’s degree, it will enable you
                        to cement your
                        foundations in computer science and attain deep theoretical knowledge in software development as
                        well as your other favourite subjects. </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Quality:</strong> The quality of education as well as assignments/ coursework anywhere abroad is really
                        good.
                        If you make it to a top university the quality of learning will be unparalleled. The whole
                        experience of moving abroad, meeting new people, living by yourself is great if you make it. If
                        you
                        decide to do it after working for a long time, like Tanay, it will be your own version of mai
                        hoon
                        na!</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Hustle:</strong> Graduating from a master’s abroad is tough. It will make you work 12-14
                        hours a day and you will barely have any time for travel. It changes you and makes you hustle
                        like crazy. Having such intelligent and hardworking peers will cause you to work hard and become
                        another version of yourself. Your professors will be very great and challenge you every day.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Answerability:</strong> All of this will definitely transform you into a butterfly from
                        a caterpillar. A
                        great story is narrated in the podcast which explores the idea: If you sign up for gym without a
                        trainer you will have no one to answer to, but a trainer will push you hard and get you results
                        which you might not get by yourself. </li>
                </p>

            </ol>
            <h1>Why you should not do it?</h1>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Cost: </strong>There is no denying that studying abroad is very expensive. The better
                        the
                        university you get into, the more will be the fees. International students also have to face the
                        exchange rates and the absence of financial aid from the university.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li><strong>Return on Investment:</strong> If you take a big loan then chances are you’ll pay it
                        back
                        for a long time. You will spend this much amount of money in 2 years which is not that long a
                        time
                        and you will pay the loan back for minimum 3 to 5 years. </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <li><strong>Career jump?: </strong>A lot of people don’t do masters and are at the same level in
                        their careers in many companies. Some just have a Bachelor’s degree, some have a Master’s and
                        some might even have 3-4 degrees but working at the same level, so you won’t really be left
                        behind if you decide not to do it. </li>
                </p>
                <p><strong> But all of these points above for not doing a master’s have many nuances. Not a lot of people have
                    the habit of pushing themselves hard. If that’s the case with someone then they should go for
                    masters. Not a lot of people are motivated enough to suppose write 100 blogs on computer science
                    topics. If you do that and work on side projects then you’ll be as good as those doing master’s,
                    however everyone knows how tempting it is to slack on side projects. Typically, ML/AI job roles
                    require that you have a master’s or even doctoral degrees from good colleges, especially if you want
                    a role at a high value company as the role requires high expertise. Also, if you have an
                    international master’s degree job prospects in India get better due to colonial mindset of society,
                    same thing without a master’s will require extreme hard work and luck. Even a state university
                    master’s from abroad is better than working super hard in certain companies where your work is like
                    pushing a wall, no matter how hard you push the wall will never move. A great thing in the podcast
                    that I loved, which Tanay advised is: at the end of the day it depends on what kind of person you
                    are. Take his perspectives and see what works for you. Will you choose paying 70L for 2 years or
                    working super hard with accountability.</strong> </p>
