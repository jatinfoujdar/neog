        <h1>component library</h1>
        <p>
            <strong> Adarsh Balika</strong> is attending neog.camp and is currently completing levelZero one weekend and
            assignment at a time.</p>

        <p> This is a component library created by her to better design each element.</p>

        <p>After creating this library she is going to use the components in her<strong> portfolio, blog and all
                projects</strong> created. This will ensure that all her projects have <strong>consistent themeing and
                styling</strong></p>
